# Casa de Copas Codex (Working Draft)

## What is Casa de Copas?
Casa de Copas is a sanctuary, a creative commons where art is not a product but a path. It is rooted in dignity, generosity, and the belief that artists deserve stability, community, and legacy. It sits in the lineage of Condesa’s recording history, transforming an old Sony Studios compound into a living myth—a place where creativity is remembered and rewarded, not exploited.

## How to Join the Movement
You can become part of the Casa de Copas family by simply signing up for an account at copas.app. This app is your gateway—it’s how you’ll pay for tickets, support artists, and engage with everything Casa de Copas offers.

If you want to support the movement in a gentle, ongoing way, you can set up a monthly donation—whether it’s a dollar, five dollars, or ten. Every bit goes directly into building our programming and nurturing the community. Over time, your consistent generosity adds to your “love count” and your standing in the house, so that you’re recognized as a supporter.

Beyond that, of course, attending events is a beautiful way to participate. We aren’t just another bar or club; we’re offering high-quality, rare experiences that come with a margin that supports the whole ecosystem. So come with generosity in your heart, knowing you’re helping sustain a space for artists.

And if you feel deeply inspired, you can even organize a local fundraiser—like a bake sale or a car wash—convert the proceeds into Palomas, and send them as a donation. This not only helps Casa grow but also quickly raises your profile in the community. It shows that you’re here to contribute first, and that spirit is always rewarded.

### Contribute Your Skills
If you have expertise in technology and want to help us develop the tech side of Casa de Copas, we’d love to have you. We’re going to start hosting weekly tech-push meetups right here at the studio. Anyone who donates their time and skills will be recognized in the house as a contributor.

And if you have a particular passion—like helping us integrate with Web3—you can support that evolution. Our eventual goal is to move from a Web2 structure into a more anonymous, decentralized, and free-floating Web3 ecosystem—a kind of “ghost society” being built within the old one. By contributing to that tech vision, you’re helping us become something truly transformative.

### Donate Resources
Another unique way to participate in Casa de Copas is by contributing to our collectively owned infrastructure. We believe in reimagining and revitalizing unused resources. If you have something that’s gathering dust—like a vintage car, an empty apartment, or even some old musical gear—you can offer it to Casa de Copas.

In return, we’ll act as guardians of that space or item. We might renovate it, give it a new coat of paint, and fold it into the Casa community’s support structure. This could be anything from a guesthouse behind your mom’s place to a beloved old synthesizer or a tape machine. Everything donated in this way is remembered by the house, and you become a kind of legend within the system for your generosity.

## The Era of Cups: A Mythic Frame
Casa de Copas isn’t just a place; it’s a mythic journey into what we call the Era of Cups. All of Western storytelling is rooted in the tale of the knight-errant, born from the legends of King Arthur. When Arthur drew the sword from the stone, it ushered humanity into the Era of Swords—an age defined by individuals wielding their intellect and power to conquer, to win spoils, and to bring them back to a king in exchange for a share of the kingdom.

Over centuries, this evolved into capitalism. We don’t reject capitalism outright—far from it—but we recognize how the concentration of resources, the weight of rent, and the burden of compound interest have created a widening chasm between the haves and the have-nots. It’s not one evil person’s doing; it’s a system that’s simply run its course.

We don’t need another critique of that system. Instead, Casa de Copas offers a pathway out—a new myth, a new era. The Era of Cups is a rebellion of generosity, a turning away from the sword and toward the cup—toward a community where art, spirit, and shared beauty are the true currency.

So if you want to truly rebel against a broken system, you don’t just complain about it. You lend your light and your skills to the Era of Cups. You become part of a new story.

## Inside the House: The Casa de Copas Experience
Imagine you step off a bustling Mexico City street and push open a door that feels like a portal. Inside, the noise of the outside world fades, replaced by the hum of creativity. You’re greeted by warm, ambient light, the scent of wood and incense, and walls that carry the echoes of countless creative sessions. 

In Casa de Copas, every room has a story. You might find a cozy corner where musicians are jamming, or a sunlit space where an artist is painting. The tokens you hold—your Palomas or Palomitas—aren’t just digital credits; they’re keys to different experiences. Maybe you trade a few for a recording session, a workshop, or a shared meal with other creatives.

But it’s not just about transactions. It’s about the feeling of stepping into a place where time slows down and the usual rules of the world are gently set aside. Here, collaboration happens naturally. You might find yourself sharing ideas with someone you’ve just met, or discovering a new project that sparks your imagination.

Events at Casa de Copas feel like intimate gatherings of a secret society—one dedicated to art and authenticity. You’re not just a guest; you’re part of a living, breathing legend. And every contribution you make—every cup you fill—adds to the story.

### The Marketplace of Wonders
As you explore Casa de Copas, you’ll notice that every event is more than just a gathering; it’s a small marketplace of wonders. We hand-select some of the finest local artisans, whether they’re massage therapists, tattoo artists, vintage clothing dealers, or other unique vendors. Each of them is a believer in the Era of Cups vision. When you buy something from them, a portion of what you spend goes right back to supporting Casa de Copas, and you earn love tokens in return. It’s a way of making every transaction a shared act of support and community.

And these aren’t just any vendors. They’re some of the best you’ll find in Mexico City, chosen not only for their skill but for their alignment with our ethos. They share the same vision of creativity, generosity, and building something new together. So as you wander through the house, you’re not just browsing a market; you’re immersing yourself in a living tapestry of art and connection.

### Hidden Rooms for the Devoted
In the early days, many of these experiences will essentially be pathways for donations to Casa de Copas—an invitation for you to help build this dream. But as more and more people step out of the mindset of the House of Swords and into the Era of Cups, new levels of benefit will unfold. For those who commit to the journey early and often, special doors will open—quite literally.

Imagine a beautiful vintage clothing dealer at an event. For most attendees, it’s already a treat. But for those who have advanced into the Cups tier of our Tarot-inspired game, there’s a hidden room—a secret space with even higher-quality treasures at lower prices. It’s our way of rewarding those who’ve helped shape Casa de Copas from the start and encouraging everyone to grow together.

As the community evolves, we’ll keep unveiling new layers of these benefits. The deeper you go, the more you’ll find—a journey of transformation from a world of scarcity to a world of shared abundance.

## The Path Forward: From Community Access to Grail Holders
Casa de Copas is open to everyone. Our studios and educational experiences are available to the general public, with a transparent price list on our website. Anyone can book studio time, join a workshop, or participate in our events. But that’s just the beginning.

As Casa grows, we’re nurturing a special tier of featured artists. These are emerging creators just starting their careers, whom we support with recording time at cost, free health and wellness programs, and high-quality, locally sourced food so they can thrive. These artists become the “Cup holders,” guaranteed a stable income of up to $3,333 a month through our cup system. Any excess they generate is poured back into the community, ensuring future artists have the same opportunity.

The ultimate goal for these Cup holders is to become Grail holders. These are the artists who dedicate their lives, their intellectual property, and their creative gifts fully to Casa de Copas. As Grail holders, they unlock a new level of support—$7,777 per month—ensuring that they can focus entirely on their art and the Casa’s mission. They become the champions, the knights of the House of Cups, remembered and honored for their contributions.

In the future, we envision providing housing for these Grail holders—spaces owned by Casa de Copas where they can live and serve as lifelong guardians of the community. These ambient support structures will help our most dedicated members continue to flourish and keep the Casa’s vision alive.

## The Builder's Journey
The story of Casa de Copas is inseparable from the story of its builder. JP’s path began in Wisconsin, studying opera at the University of Wisconsin and singing in boy choir from a young age. Music was always more than sound—it was a calling, a discipline, a way of life. 

One formative vision came in the midst of work at a conveyor belt: an almost mystical sense that the old systems of scarcity and extraction could give way to something new. That vision would eventually take root in Casa de Copas.

From Wisconsin, the path led to Nashville, where years were spent wrestling with the traditional music industry. There, JP saw firsthand the exploitation that too often devours emerging artists—the way labels treated creativity as free R&D for profit rather than a covenant of dignity and legacy. Those years were a crucible, shaping the conviction that there must be a different way.

That different way is Casa de Copas: a sanctuary where the lessons of the past—discipline, craft, and resilience—meet a new mythology of Cups, generosity, and shared abundance. This is not just an organization; it is the culmination of a personal quest to rebel against the broken towers of the old world and to build, instead, a living Grail for artists.
