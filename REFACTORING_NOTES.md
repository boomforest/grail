# Refactoring Notes - Main.jsx Cleanup

## What We've Done

1. **Extracted Components** (Safe ✅)
   - `WelcomeModal` → `src/components/WelcomeModal.jsx`
   - `PayPalButton` → `src/components/PayPalButton.jsx`

2. **Created Custom Hooks** (Not integrated yet)
   - `src/hooks/useSupabase.js` - Manages Supabase initialization and auth
   - `src/hooks/useNotifications.js` - Handles notification loading and subscriptions

3. **Created ViewRouter Component** (Not integrated yet)
   - `src/components/ViewRouter.jsx` - Handles all conditional rendering logic

## Current Status

- ✅ Components extracted and imports added to main.jsx
- ✅ Removed duplicate code (leftover PayPal component)
- ✅ Reduced main.jsx from 1355 to 963 lines
- ⚠️  Custom hooks and ViewRouter created but NOT integrated

## Next Steps (When You're Ready)

### Option 1: Test Current Changes Only (Safest)
```bash
npm run dev
```
Just verify that the extracted components work correctly.

### Option 2: Continue Refactoring (More Complex)
To fully integrate the new structure, you would need to:

1. Update main.jsx to use the custom hooks
2. Replace all the conditional rendering with ViewRouter
3. Test thoroughly

This would reduce main.jsx to ~200 lines but requires careful testing.

## Benefits So Far

1. **Easier to understand** - Components are in logical files
2. **Easier to modify** - PayPal and Welcome modal changes won't require editing main.jsx
3. **Better organization** - Clear separation of concerns

## Recommendation

Start by testing the current changes. The app should work exactly as before but with better organization. Once you're comfortable, you can gradually integrate the hooks and ViewRouter.

## Testing Checklist
